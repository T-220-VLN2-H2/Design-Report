\section{User Testing}

For our user tests we had an opportunity to do a heuristic evaluation and a general user test, first one with a computer science student who does professional tests for different programs and second round with a student not involved with computer science. Both tests were made on Reykjav√≠k University campus on April 29th 2022 in a private room where users had to solve 9 different tasks with varying difficulty.\\

Overall user testing solidified the teams work on the design and showed an overall average accuracy of 100\% and all tasks were a success, though general speed of tasks was inconsistent between users as expected. Feedback was also positive overall and the users expressed good thoughts of the simplicity of navigating between different pages.\\

We consider the results of user testing a overwhelming success on this design phase and are happy with the result.\\
