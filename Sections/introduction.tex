\section{Introduction}

FireSale! continues to grow and the online marketplace design is becoming more structured. The team behind FireSale! has goals of creating a powerful online presence that creates great opportunities for it's users for online sales and purchases of items of all kinds and sizes. The designs found within this report will become a vital building blocks for the coming weeks when programming the front end, back end and database will take place. \\

 The team wanted the appearance of FireSale! to represent it's name so a prototype was created using Figma using a color palette promoting colors of fire. The prototype displays how the user can navigate the website but with no real functionality behind it. This design was also based off wireframes used in the previous phase so a similar navigation for the website is present with minor adjustments being made to fix previous design flaws. \\

 Foundation has been laid for programming with a class diagram being made to identify key objects and attributes of the product. Programming rules have been decided on to maintain nice and clean, readable code that has good form all around. And a navigation diagram to have a good sense of how to connect paths throughout the website. All of these creations can be found within this report.
