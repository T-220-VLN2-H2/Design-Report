\section{Prototype}
    The prototype continued our focus around our goal of keeping the site as simple as possible for users. With the useful feedback from our low-fidelity prototype interview we managed to fix some glaring problems whilst making the site even more user friendly. \\
    
    We put emphasis on making the buttons stand out from other non-interactive visual elements and have at most 5 steps for each given action. This was reflected in the exercises we used in the user testing. \\
    
    The following images show most of the functionality for the site with a reasonable flow from picture to picture.\\
