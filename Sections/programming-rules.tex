\section{Programming Rules}

In this section we describe code conventions, tooling and coding workflow we intend to use for FireSale!\\

\noindent
For version control we are using git, hosting the repo on GitHub, the repos \textit{main} branch is write protected to ensure proper workflow through Pull Requests (PRs). We also utilise \textit{.gitignore} to keep unwanted file out of the repo.\\

\noindent
To help us keep the code-bases' indents, newlines and encoding consistent across the multiple filetypes and operating systems we use \href{https://editorconfig.org}{\textit{editorconfig}}.\\

\noindent The UTF-8 encoding and UNIX newlines are used for all files unless otherwise specified.

\subsection{Linting}
All PRs merged with the main branch will automatically be linted for code consistency, this is done either manually or with CI if we find time to set it up.

\subsection{Comments}
Through out the code we comment all functions and classes with some form of doc strings containing a description of what the function does along with listing of parameters and expected output.\\

\noindent
Inline comments should have two full spaces before and one after the comment symbol/s followed by a short and concise comment.\\

\noindent
If someone ever notices a bug but for what ever reason canÂ´t deal with at that time, comment 'FIXME: <short description or link to Asana>'. For functionality yet to be implemented we'll comment 'TODO: <short description or link to Asana>', this makes searching for found bugs and missing functionality easier.\\

}

\subsection{CSS}
Our CSS code conventions are quite straight forward, everything in a block should be lowercase, use four space soft tab for indenting, and leave a single empty line between blocks.

\subsection{HTML}
HTML files we have more points to consider than for CSS.

\begin{itemize}
	\item all tags and attributes should be in lowercase
	\item opened tags need to be closed
	\item no space around = in attribute assignment
	\item attribute values encased in double quotes
	\item images have alt, width and height defined
	\item \textbf{no inline css or js!}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Java Script}
JavaScript is probably has the wildest style guides out there, but we decided to follow googles JS style guide even if it's a long winded read.
\begin{itemize}
	\item sum google style
	\item % TODO: sum googles js code style
	\item eval evil
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Python}
For Python we plan on following \href{https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/}{PEP8} as closely one finds reasonable.\\

\noindent
To give a brief summery on PEP8:
\begin{itemize}
    \item variables and functions are named in snake\_case
    \item space between all operators
    \item space after a ', ' not before
    \item leave two empty lines between functions and/or classes, but one line between functions in the same class
    \item all functions and classes should have a docstring summarising their inner workings, parameters, and return values
    \item when defining a function use typing where it applies
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SQL}
% TODO: write small intro
\begin{itemize}
    \item keywords in lowercase
    \item indents should create a 'river' down the length of each given query, between keywords and parameters
\end{itemize}
